## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

# Dependency

You need to install [rpi gpio](https://github.com/ClockVapor/rpi_gpio) library.
If you encounter problems related with permissions you can change ownership of `/dev/gpiomem` folder with `sudo chown root.gpio /dev/gpiomem
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem` chmod one will give write permissions.

sc = PiMote::Sockets.new
sc.switch_on(socket_number)
sc.switch_off(socket_number)

sc.switch_on # all sockets on
sc.switch_off # all sockets on
```
